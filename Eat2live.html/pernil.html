        <h3 class="prep">Preparation</h3>
        <p class="prep">First, you're going to want to cut underneath the skin of the pork so that you can lift it off while it's till attached. After that,
            stab the pork all over, making large holes. You'll want to shove your finger inside to expand these holes so you can fill them. Next, in a bowl, combine 
            your salt, garlic powder, black pepper, oregano, Balsamic vinegar and olive oil. It should make a nice paste when you mix it. Rub this paste all over and shove it in the 
            holes you made earlier. Season the bottom of the skin with Adobo, and score the top, then also season that with Adobo. Let the pork marinate overnight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="action">Action</h3>
        <p class="action">Pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees. Put the pork in a roasting pan and let it cook for 4 hours covered. Then take off the cover and turn up the heat to 375 and let it cook for another hour. If the skin is crispy
            that should be enough time. If not, give it another 30 minutes and so on until it's ready. That is how you make Puerto Rican style pork.
