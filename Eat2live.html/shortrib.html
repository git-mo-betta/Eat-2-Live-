            <h3>Preperation</h3>
            <p>First dice up the carrots, celery, and the onions. Get rid of the silver skin on the short ribs and throw them in a heated pan
                with 2 tablespoons of avocado oil. Get a good sear, and when you're satisfied with the amount of fond on the bottom of the pan
                take them out. Deglaze the pan with the mirepoix. After you've sweated the veggies on a nice low heat for about 20 minutes, season them, and
                squirt in some tomato paste. Drop the shortibs back in and pour in the whole bottle (750ml) of wine and a carton of beef stock. Don't cover.

            <h3>Action</h3>
            <p>Most of this dish is prep but there is a couple more steps. You'll want to stir every couple hours as this is a 7 hour Stew.
                If the liquid gets too low, add more stock. After 7 hours, take out the beef and place in a container. Pour the juice in a container. Put both
                of these in the fridge when they cool enough. The next day, fish out the layer of fat on the broth, reduce the broth and add 1/4 cup of prune juice in the 
                reduction. When the sauce is to your liking, put the beef back in and slowly heat it up. Serve over mash potatoes or white rice.
