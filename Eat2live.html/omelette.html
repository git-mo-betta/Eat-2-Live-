        <h3 class="prep">Preparation</h3>
        <p class="prep">First, dice your onions, your mushrooms, and your spinach. The spinach is more of a chop but you want it to small small and 
            proportional to the veg. Crack your eggs, beat them and lightly salt.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="action">Action</h3>
        <p class="action">Heat a teaspoon of olive oil on a nonstick pan. On medium low heat, saut√© the diced onions and mushrooms for a about a minute. Be 
            careful not to burn them or even really caramlize because at this point we're just trying to soften them. After one minute, drop in the spinach and move all of it to the center of the pan
            and pour the eggs in right over top of the mix. Lightly work a spatula underneath the sides of the omelette. When enough of it has been cooked, preceed to roll the omelette upon itself and flip it over. 
            After 30 seconds you can take it out and it'll finish itself on the plate. Just like that you'll have a natural pre-workout for your saturday mornings.
