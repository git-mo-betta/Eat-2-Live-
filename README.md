Eat-2-Live- is a project I started months ago, long before I had a git or knew anything
about git. Now that i'm more experienced I aim to finish the project and 
track it on github.

Eat-2-Live- is a website that features different recipies I use in my daily cooking.
It should consist of a home page and links to different pages of recipies.
